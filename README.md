# Feedback Hub

> **The first feedback platform where users *see* their impact, teams *ship* faster, and products grow *together*.**

## Overview

**Feedback Hub** is a revolutionary social-first feedback platform that bridges the gap between GitHub Issues and Twitter-like social interactions. We're transforming how products collect, prioritize, and act on user feedback through transparent workflows, gamified engagement, and measurable impact tracking.

### Why Feedback Hub?

Traditional feedback tools are broken. They're either too technical (GitHub Issues) or too disconnected from development workflows (traditional feedback widgets). Feedback Hub solves this by creating a transparent, social environment where:

- **Users see their impact** through real-time status updates and Impact Scores
- **Teams ship faster** with streamlined workflows and AI-powered insights  
- **Products grow together** through community-driven prioritization
